Algorithm: K-th Highest Score Using Min Heap

1. Start
2. Read integers k and n
3. Create an empty min heap
4. Repeat for each incoming score:
5. Read score x
6. If heap size is less than k, insert x into heap
7. Else if x is greater than the top of heap:
8. Remove the top element from heap
9. Insert x into heap
10. If heap size is less than k, output -1
11. Else output the top of heap
12. End
